# RAMPART_TorientalisMultiplex_Genes_Cytb_Dhodh_Pin1
This repository contains comprehensive scripts for analysis of the Theileria orientalis multiplex genes cytb (cytochrome b), dhodh (dihydroorotate dehydrogenase), and pin1 (peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase NIMA-interacting 1). The repository aims to provide realtime nucleotide level mapping of nanopore sequencing to the reference sequences.
